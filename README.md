# psp-gatekeeper-policies

This repo contains common policies needed in Pod Security Policy but implemented as Constraints and Constraint Templates with Gatekeeper.

A [Pod Security Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/) is a cluster-level resource that controls security
sensitive aspects of the pod specification. The `PodSecurityPolicy` objects define a set of conditions that a pod must run with in order to be accepted into
the system, as well as defaults for the related fields.

[Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeepe) is a customizable admission webhook for Kubernetes that enforces policies executed by the [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org), a policy engine for Cloud Native environments hosted by CNCF.

An adminstrator can control the following by setting the field in PSP or by deploying the corresponding Gatekeeper constraint and constraint templates:

| Control Aspect                                    | Field Names in PSP                                                          | Gatekeeper Constraint and Constraint Template                    |
